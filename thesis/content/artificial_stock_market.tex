\section{Artificial Market}
% What is ASM, what kinds of structures they have
Artificial markets are simulation environments for analyzing, 
reproducing and gaining understanding of the dynamics of the 
real markets \citet{Julien07}. 

Based on the market mechanics, \citet{boer05} distinguished 
three types of artificial markets: analytical,
experinental and computational. Analytical models are a
set of mathematical equations that describe how a
market works. Experimental models are controlled laboratories 
where humans act as the trading agents and in computational
models software agents act as the trading agents. 

\subsection{Synchronous and Asynchronous ASM}

The interaction between the agents and markets can be synchronous
or asynchronous. In synchronous artificial markets, the orders
submission takes turns and each agent has identical opportunity
to state their orders. In asynchronous artificial markets
the time handling is more realistic: traders' decisions are 
relayed to market independently. \citep{Julien07}
