\section{Literature Review}

Santa Fe institute's computational artificial stock 
market is considered to be one of the first of a kind. 
The focus of the simulation structure is more in the 
decision making process of the traders rather than in the 
market's microstructure. The model's traders use 
genetic algorithm to form a pool of rules to follow
in their decision making process. The traders can buy or
sell either risk free bond or risky dividend yielding stock.
The market is quote-driven in a sense that the traders
either accept the current price set up by the clearing house
or do not trade. The price goes up in case of there is excess
demand and vice versa. (\citeauthor{SantaFe94}, \citeyear{SantaFe94} 
and \citeauthor{SantaFe99}, \citeyear{SantaFe99})

Since then there have been many more models being 
developed with various complexities. These models are often developed
for achieving specific properties of a real market, 
usually related to the price formation. In this section
go through recent literature to describe some of the models
that has been built and discuss the design decisions in them.

\subsection{Zero Intelligent Traders}
\citet{God93} observed market efficiency in a market setting
of minimal intelligence. They conducted a partly human and partly
computational laboratory experiment to replicate the market
efficiency of human traders with least intelligent computational
trading agents. \\

Their market is organized as a double auction with several
specifications. The market is continuous in a sense that the 
orders are continuously matched even though the trading was
conducted in speicified sessions. The traders were divided 
into buyers and sellers. Buyers profits were tied to their 
individual redemption values that are gained at the end of
each trading session for each bough unit and sellers' profits
were tied to their individual cost of unit. Redemption values
represent the demand function of each buyer and cost of units 
the supply function of each seller for each session. The
traders were allowed to submit orders with size of one unit
and the trade price was taken from the price stated in the 
first of the crossing orders. \\

The computational trading agents were zero intelligent traders 
who trade at random price from a predefined range. 
The first simulation was run with budget constrain: only the bids
under the redemption value and the asks over the cost of unit 
were allowed. The second simulation was run without such limitation.
These simulations were compared with the data from human traders. \\

\citeauthor{God93} found that the budget constrain is enough to 
achieve market efficiency very close to human traders. Their findings
suggest that intelligence does not to play critical role in terms of 
how to build an efficient artificial market. The more important aspect
is the characteristics of the market, not the traders. \\


% Continuation study from Jamal & Sunder
\citet{Jam96} expanded \citeauthor{God93}'s work and added behavioural 
elements to similar market structure. They tested the rationality of
a market with three different trader populations: bayesian, empirical
bayesian and heuristical traders. Bayesian and empirical bayesian acted
as baselines for the market rationality and heuristical traders were
the treatment populations for which the researchers added behavioural
elements: representativeness bias and anchor-and-adjust. 

The traders in all populations were zero intelligent in terms of what
price they bid and ask. Most notable difference to \citet{God93}'s market
is that instead of redemption value and cost of units determining the
supply and demand values, \citeauthor{Jam96} used private dividend payouts 
to act as such. The dividend payout is random but traders are informed
about two possible dividends. There is also an imperfect signal that the
traders can utilize to determine which of the payouts is more probable.


% Another example of Intelligence vs Structure
\citet{Raberto05} experimented with ZI investors in market setting
where each computational traders can submit bid and ask offers. Their
market was also a continuous double auction which has realistic order
book setup. In their market, the traders issue random bid and ask limit
orders with a price that follows normal distribution. The mean of this 
normal distribution is the best price of the opposite book and the 
standard deviation is constant in the first experiment and linearly 
dependent on the volatility of the stock in the second experiment. The
traders do have a budget constrain. \\

\citeauthor{Raberto05} found that the fat tailed returns observed in
real stock markets can be achieved in artificial settings using limit 
order book in the price formation and it is not consequence of clearing 
house mechanism itself. They also found that volatility clusters can
be achieved with a simple dependency on the volatility. Their paper
is furher evidence that the market microstructure may be more
important than the complexity of the traders in effort to replicate
many of the properties of real markets.
