\section{Introduction}

Due to the chaotic elements and lack of control in financial markets, 
empirical research faces variety of challenges in effort to study the 
behaviour of markets. Lack of data, spurious relations and changing market 
conditions are serious is-sues that empirical researchers often 
face, and the researchers are simply lim-ited with the conditions 
that the real markets currently have or have had in the past. 
There are seldom obvious and robust ways to test alternative scenarios with real data. \\ 

However, the mechanics of how markets work are well 
understood as they are inherently artificial structures 
even though the behaviour of the participants is not. 
Therefore, it is possible to build a controlled environment 
in which the asset positions and optimal trades and outcomes 
are completely known whereas all the unknown elements are reduced 
to the participants? behaviour. These kinds of environments can be 
used to support theoretical arguments and empirical findings.\\

Such controlled environments can have human or artificial participants. 
(Some-thing about human control environment studies?).\\

Artificial participants are often used for determining the minimum required intel-ligence 
for various phenomena in markets and for substituting human 
partici-pants in cases where having them would be impractical. 
The simplest form of ar-tificial participants is zero-intelligence (ZI) traders. 
ZI traders trade completely randomly with underlying statistical distribution. 
Even though ZI traders cannot be considered rational, markets formed with such 
traders are shown to be able to reach near perfect allocation when there is a 
budget constrain. These kinds of markets are also shown to be far from the 
competitive equilibrium of which hu-man participants could achieve when demand is seasonal but determined.\\

Agent based traders are often used to simulate the human behaviour. 
Most of-ten this term is associated with types of traders that follow predefined, 
hardcod-ed set of rules. There rules are often based on theoretical 
frameworks such as utility theory and they are often used for 
Most of such traders have a set of rules built into them that \\




Even though financial markets are essential part of modern economy, their be-haviour is relatively poorly understood.\\ 

Santa-Fe Institute?s simulation environment is often seen as the first artificial stock market?\\
