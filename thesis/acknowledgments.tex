\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank the open source community of Julia and Python
that has enabled me to learn on my own so much about the technologies.
Without the helpful communities I would be missing so much of what
I am now.

I would also like to thank my friends and family that have tolerated
my ambitious but sometimes far-fetched ideas, including this one.
