In the construction of the model, the forms of the virtual dealers' utility function and learning methods were derived from field data. The results of simulating the artificial market were compared with the field data. First, the temporal movements of agents' forecasts in the simulation were compared with those of actual dealers as given by survey data. Next, the factors that the virtual dealers regarded as significant in forecasting were categorized. The categories were compared to those of actual dealers and found to be similar. Finally, the temporal changes in virtual dealers' opinions were compared with data obtained through interviews with actual dealers. The proposed model was found to enable repeated and detailed analysis of dealer thinking under various conditions in real time."

The market is composed of many boundedly rational and heterogeneous traders whose learning behavior is represented by a genetic programming algorithm. We calibrate the model to replicate several stylized facts observed in real financial markets. Based on this environment, the impacts of price limits are analyzed from the perspectives of volatility, price distortion, volume, and welfare. We find that the imposition of price limits possesses both positive and negative effects. However, compared with the market without price limits, appropriate price limits help to reduce volatility and price distortion, and increase the liquidity and welfare."

abstract = "In this paper, we propose a new architecture to study artificial stock markets. This architecture rests on a mechanism called ‘school’ which is a procedure to map the phenotype to the genotype or, in plain English, to uncover the secret of success. We propose an agent-based model of ‘school’, and consider school as an evolving population driven by single-population GP (SGP). The architecture also takes into consideration traders’ search behavior. By simulated annealing, traders’ search density can be connected to psychological factors, such as peer pressure or economic factors such as the standard of living. This market architecture was then implemented in a standard artificial stock market. Our econometric study of the resultant artificial time series evidences that the return series is independently and identically distributed (iid), and hence supports the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). What is interesting though is that this iid series was generated by traders, who do not believe in the EMH at all. In fact, our study indicates that many of our traders were able to find useful signals quite often from business school, even though these signals were short-lived."
