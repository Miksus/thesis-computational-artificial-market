abstract="Stock market is a complex system composed from heterogeneous traders with highly non-linear interactions from which emerge a phenomenon of speculative bubble. To understand the role of heterogeneous behaviors of traders and interactions between them in the emergence of bubbles, we propose an agent-based model of double auction market, with asynchronous time management, where traders act asynchronously and take different times to make decisions. The market is populated by heterogeneous traders. In addition to fundamentalist, noise, and technical (chartist) traders, we propose a hybrid trader, which can switch between technical (chartist) and fundamentalist strategies integrating panicking behavior. We find that when market is populated by a majority of hybrid traders, we observe quite realistic bubble formation characterized by a boom phase when hybrid traders switch to technical behavior, followed by a relatively shorter burst phase when hybrid traders return to fundamentalist strategy and change to panicked state. The aim is to design agents which act asynchronously, with simple behaviors, but complex enough to produce realistic price dynamics, which provide a basis for developing agents with sophisticated decision-making processes.",

We address this question by comparing the impact of the organization of trading on volume, liquidity, and price efficiency in a quote-driven dealer market and in an order-driven limit order book. Small order price impacts are higher and large order price impacts are lower in a dealer market. Prices are more efficient in the limit order book, except when the level of informed trading is high. Volume is higher in a limit order market, making this system most attractive for trading venues."

We first discuss some general issues common to all statistical studies of financial time series. Various statistical properties of asset returns are then described: distributional properties, tail properties and extreme fluctuations, pathwise regularity, linear and nonlinear dependence of returns in time and across stocks. Our description emphasizes properties common to a wide variety of markets and instruments. We then show how these statistical properties invalidate many of the common statistical approaches used to study financial data sets and examine some of the statistical problems encountered in each case.

    abstract = { High-frequency financial time series data have an ability to define market microstructure and are helpful in making rational real-time decisions. These data sets carry unique characteristics and properties which are not available in low-frequency data; with that high-frequency data also create more challenges and opportunities for econometric modelling and financial data analysis. So it is essential to know the features and the facts related to the high-frequency time series data. In this article, we provide the characteristics and stylized facts exhibited by the high-frequency financial time series data of the S\&P CNX Nifty futures index. Stylized facts are mostly related to the empirical observed behaviours, distributional properties, autocorrelation function and seasonality of the high-frequency data. Also, it illustrates the importance of stationarity in financial time series analysis. The knowledge of such facts and concepts is helpful to establish better empirical models and to produce reliable forecasts. }

This survey highlights the insights that have emerged from the wealth of empirical and theoretical studies of LOBs.

The agent-based stock market was based on the DFGIS model proposed by Daniels, Farmer, Gillemot, Iori and Smith (Daniels et al., 2003). We also improved the DFGIS model by using two average order size parameters. When tested on 10 stocks and securities in the market, the model-simulated liquidity costs were higher than those of the TWSE data. We identified some possible factors that have contributed to this result: 1) the overestimated effective market order size, which can be improved by using two average order size parameters; 2) the random market order arrival time designed in the DFGIS model; 3) the zero-intelligence of the artificial agents in our model; and 4) the price of the effective market order. We continued improving the model so that it could be used to study liquidity costs and to devise liquidation strategies for stocks and securities traded in the Taiwan Stock Market."

This conjecture motivated us to investigate the roles of both the market microstructure and agent behavior with respect to high-frequency returns and daily returns. We developed two simple models to investigate this issue. The first one is a stochastic model with a clearing house microstructure and a population of zero-intelligence agents. The second one has more behavioral assumptions based on Minority Game and also has a clearing house microstructure. With the first model we found that a characteristic of the clearing house microstructure, namely the clearing frequency, can explain fat tail, excess volatility and autocorrelation phenomena of high-frequency returns. However, this feature does not cause the same phenomena in daily returns. So the Stylized Facts of daily returns depend mainly on the agents’ behavior. With the second model we investigated the effects of behavioral assumptions on daily returns. Our study implicates that the aspects which are responsible for generating the stylized facts of high-frequency returns and daily returns are different."

First, the temporal movements of agents' forecasts in the simulation were compared with those of actual dealers as given by survey data. Next, the factors that the virtual dealers regarded as significant in forecasting were categorized. The categories were compared to those of actual dealers and found to be similar. Finally, the temporal changes in virtual dealers' opinions were compared with data obtained through interviews with actual dealers. The proposed model was found to enable repeated and detailed analysis of dealer thinking under various conditions in real time."

We use the model for the analysis of market self-regulation abilities, market efficiency and determinants of emergent properties of the financial market. Distinctive and novel features of the model include strong emphasis on the economic content of individual decision-making, application of the Q-learning algorithm for driving individual behaviour, and rich market setup. Along with that a parallel version of the model is presented, which is mainly based on research of current changes in the market, as well as on search of newly emerged consistent patterns, and which has been repeatedly used for optimal decisions' search experiments in various capital markets.

The market is composed of many boundedly rational and heterogeneous traders whose learning behavior is represented by a genetic programming algorithm. We calibrate the model to replicate several stylized facts observed in real financial markets. Based on this environment, the impacts of price limits are analyzed from the perspectives of volatility, price distortion, volume, and welfare. We find that the imposition of price limits possesses both positive and negative effects. However, compared with the market without price limits, appropriate price limits help to reduce volatility and price distortion, and increase the liquidity and welfare."
