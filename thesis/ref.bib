abstract="Stock market is a complex system composed from heterogeneous traders with highly non-linear interactions from which emerge a phenomenon of speculative bubble. To understand the role of heterogeneous behaviors of traders and interactions between them in the emergence of bubbles, we propose an agent-based model of double auction market, with asynchronous time management, where traders act asynchronously and take different times to make decisions. The market is populated by heterogeneous traders. In addition to fundamentalist, noise, and technical (chartist) traders, we propose a hybrid trader, which can switch between technical (chartist) and fundamentalist strategies integrating panicking behavior. We find that when market is populated by a majority of hybrid traders, we observe quite realistic bubble formation characterized by a boom phase when hybrid traders switch to technical behavior, followed by a relatively shorter burst phase when hybrid traders return to fundamentalist strategy and change to panicked state. The aim is to design agents which act asynchronously, with simple behaviors, but complex enough to produce realistic price dynamics, which provide a basis for developing agents with sophisticated decision-making processes.",

The experiments feature random values and costs, and therefore a new price formation observation each period. We find that efficiency is high and rises with experience in this environment. We also find that trades with greater exchange surplus tend to occur earlier in the period, that increased trader experience reduces an anomalous intertemporal arbitrage opportunity observed previously, and that only when traders are very experienced does exchange surplus accrue disproportionately to the side of the market with a smaller number of traders."

We address this question by comparing the impact of the organization of trading on volume, liquidity, and price efficiency in a quote-driven dealer market and in an order-driven limit order book. Small order price impacts are higher and large order price impacts are lower in a dealer market. Prices are more efficient in the limit order book, except when the level of informed trading is high. Volume is higher in a limit order market, making this system most attractive for trading venues."

@article{StylizedFacts01,
    Abstract = {We present a set of stylized empirical facts emerging from the statistical analysis of price variations in various types of financial markets. We first discuss some general issues common to all statistical studies of financial time series. Various statistical properties of asset returns are then described: distributional properties, tail properties and extreme fluctuations, pathwise regularity, linear and nonlinear dependence of returns in time and across stocks. Our description emphasizes properties common to a wide variety of markets and instruments. We then show how these statistical properties invalidate many of the common statistical approaches used to study financial data sets and examine some of the statistical problems encountered in each case.

    abstract = { High-frequency financial time series data have an ability to define market microstructure and are helpful in making rational real-time decisions. These data sets carry unique characteristics and properties which are not available in low-frequency data; with that high-frequency data also create more challenges and opportunities for econometric modelling and financial data analysis. So it is essential to know the features and the facts related to the high-frequency time series data. In this article, we provide the characteristics and stylized facts exhibited by the high-frequency financial time series data of the S\&P CNX Nifty futures index. Stylized facts are mostly related to the empirical observed behaviours, distributional properties, autocorrelation function and seasonality of the high-frequency data. Also, it illustrates the importance of stationarity in financial time series analysis. The knowledge of such facts and concepts is helpful to establish better empirical models and to produce reliable forecasts. }

    Abstract = {Limit order books (LOBs) match buyers and sellers in more than half of the world’s financial markets. This survey highlights the insights that have emerged from the wealth of empirical and theoretical studies of LOBs. We examine the findings reported by statistical analyses of historical LOB data and discuss how several LOB models provide insight into certain aspects of the mechanism. We also illustrate that many such models poorly resemble real LOBs and that several well-established empirical facts have yet to be reproduced satisfactorily. Finally, we identify several key unresolved questions about LOBs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
