 abstract = {We compare two competing theories of financial anomalies: "behavioral" theories built on investor irrationality, and "rational structural uncertainty" theories built on incomplete information about the structure of the economic environment. We find that although the theories relax opposite assumptions of the rational expectations ideal, their mathematical and predictive similarities make them difficult to distinguish. Even if irrationality generates financial anomalies, their disappearance still may hinge on rational learning-that is, on the ability of rational arbitrageurs and their investors to reject competing rational explanations for observed price patterns.},

This paper explores some of the early works in the area concentrating on a set of some of the earliest papers. Six papers are summarized in detail, along with references to many other pieces of this wide ranging research area. It also covers many of the questions that new researchers will face when getting into the field, and hopefully can serve as a kind of minitutorial for those interested in getting started."

abstract={Abstract This paper reviews the development of agent-based (computational) economics (ACE) from an econometrics viewpoint. The review comprises three stages, characterizing the past, the present, and the future of this development. The first two stages can be interpreted as an attempt to build the econometric foundation of ACE, and, through that, enrich its empirical content. The second stage may then invoke a reverse reflection on the possible agent-based foundation of econometrics. While ACE modeling has been applied to different branches of economics, the one, and probably the only one, which is able to provide evidence of this three-stage development is finance or financial economics. We will, therefore, focus our review only on the literature of agent-based computational finance, or, more specifically, the agent-based modeling of financial markets. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = "We analyze data from experimental asset markets with pooled linear regression models to shed some light on the emergence of fat tails and volatility clustering in return distributions. Our data suggest that the arrival of new information is the most important cause for both stylized facts. After new information arrives we see spikes in volatility as this information is digested in the market. We also find that uninformed traders contribute significantly more to fat tails than do informed traders and that the heterogeneity in fundamental information leads to larger returns."

abstract={Inspired by the theoretically oriented dynamic analysis of moving average rules in the model of Chiarella, He, and Hommes (CHH) Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 30 (2006), 1729--1753], this paper conducts a dynamic analysis of a more realistic microstructure model of continuous double auctions in which the probability of heterogeneous agents trading is determined by the rules of either fundamentalists mean-reverting to the fundamental or chartists choosing moving average rules based on their relative performance. With such a realistic market microstructure, the model is able not only to obtain the results of the CHH model but also to characterize most of the stylized facts including volatility clustering, insignificant autocorrelations (ACs) of returns, and significant slowly decaying ACs of the absolute returns. The results seem to suggest that a comprehensive explanation of several statistical properties of returns is possible in a framework where both behavioral traits and realistic microstructure have a role.
