 abstract = {We compare two competing theories of financial anomalies: "behavioral" theories built on investor irrationality, and "rational structural uncertainty" theories built on incomplete information about the structure of the economic environment. We find that although the theories relax opposite assumptions of the rational expectations ideal, their mathematical and predictive similarities make them difficult to distinguish. Even if irrationality generates financial anomalies, their disappearance still may hinge on rational learning-that is, on the ability of rational arbitrageurs and their investors to reject competing rational explanations for observed price patterns.},

abstract = "The use of computer simulated markets with individual adaptive agents in finance is a new, but growing field. This paper explores some of the early works in the area concentrating on a set of some of the earliest papers. Six papers are summarized in detail, along with references to many other pieces of this wide ranging research area. It also covers many of the questions that new researchers will face when getting into the field, and hopefully can serve as a kind of minitutorial for those interested in getting started."
